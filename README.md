# Reddit Vocab

## Description

A python project that aims to analyze lexical diversity of Reddit comment sections. Measure of lexical textual diversity (MTLD) as described by McCarthy and Jarvis (2010) is used. The average sentence length of each comment is also calculated. Currently, the script analyzes top comments of top 10 posts of all time in the following subreddits:

- askreddit
- askhistorians
- philosophy
- news
- funny
- animalcrossing
- aww

The resulting data is formated as JSON, and stored in the ./data subdirectory as a .txt file.
Feel Free to modify the subreddits you want to analyze.

## How to run
